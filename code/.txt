‘There are two important concepls al the heart of object-oriented programming. The frst is
the dea of encapsulation, By this we mean the bundling together of data atvibutes and the
‘methods for operating on them, For example:

Rafael = MITPerson( Rafael Reif)

We can use dot notation to access attributes such as Rafae!'s name and identification
number

“The second important concept is information hiding. This is one ofthe key to modular if
those part ofthe program that use a class (Le. the clients of the class) rely onthe
‘specifications ofthe methods in the class, a programmer implementing the class is free to
‘change the implementation of the class(e 9. to improve efficiency) without worrying that the
‘change will break code that uses the class.

Python 3 uses naming convention to make attributes invisible outside the class. When the
name of an attribute starts with but does not nd with __ that attribute is nt visible
‘outside the clas.

Example: invisible (private) attributes.
